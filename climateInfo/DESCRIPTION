Description: Implementation of functions that extract a required regional area and
    time period from input data file. Then on this subset functions are performed 
    to compute some simple time series and statistics (e.g. regional annual means;
    trend under linear model).Plots of these statistics are saved in a folder
    which is created after user is asked to enter a directory. Naming convention 
    of folder 'var.project_id.model_id.timeperiod.region'.    Purpose of this 
    package is to get an overview over a specific datamodel in form of plots. User 
    will be asked if he/she wishes to write data in csv fomat and save it in same 
    folder.     Note: Package  only applicable on data with a lon/lat
    coordinate reference system on regular grid and  one level of observation. If 
    there is more than one level of observations, functions are performed only on lev 1.  The
    data must be of either monthly or daily observations. The package is expandable 
    and functions for other types of data can be added easily.
